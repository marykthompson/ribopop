# Snakemake workflow: ribopop_rnaseq

This workflow performs analysis of RNA-Seq data for the Ribo-Pop paper.
First sequences are downloaded, and STAR and Kallisto indices are built.
Transcript abundance is estimated with Kallisto and gene-level differential
expression analysis is performed with DESeq2. Reads are also aligned with STAR
and subjected to QC analysis with RSeQC.

The following repository was used as an initial template:
